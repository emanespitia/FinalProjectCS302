# Task manager on React

## Project description

This project is mean to create program using the react framework. This is a task manager program. You type in your task and it will be displayed o screen in a list with a delet button for you to dlet e once the task is complete. 

# Dowwnloading and using the program

In order to be able to run this program you will need to downlaod Nodes.js. First you will need to download nodes.js from nodes.org website. Make sure you donwload it for your perspective machine weather it is Apple IOS or Windows. Once yo uhave done that you can now download the code from Github and run it. You open up your project downloaded in vs, them in the terminal inside vs code and you type in "npm start" this  will start to run the app downloaded and it will open a new window in your browser and run the project downloaded.

# Making your own file from scratch to create a project

if you just wish to make your own project from scratch you will still need to download nodes.js, but instead of downlaoding a file and "using npm start" in the terminal nwe will create a new project. First open up a blank folder in vs code. Next you will open up the terminal and type "npx create-react-app {name of project}". This will create the files necessary and download the required packages for you to se this framework. This might take a bit of time. Once the project has been created you will see the files show up in your folder with the project name. Once it finalizes you can open terminal up again and then type in "npm start" this will start the program and run the code, a browser will pop up with the react logo spining. you can now go into the files and create your own project and mess about freely. 

# using and troubleshooting react
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
